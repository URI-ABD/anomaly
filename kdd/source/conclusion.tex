\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We conclude that Manifold Learning via CHESS lays a strong foundation for both introspective and online anomaly detection.
The clustering mechanism faithfully maps the underlying manifold, given the proper stopping conditions.

Future works in this area should examine more novel stopping criteria, specifically ones that allow automated manifold detection.
Additionally, work should be carried out to examine how this technique scales to higher dimensional data and how different distance functions impact performance.

In this paper, we have cleared the way for work towards automated manifold detection, introspective and online anomaly detection, and the novel concept of depth-wise graphs within the manifold itself.
