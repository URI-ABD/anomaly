	abstract = {The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing that the latent space of such generators captures semantic variation in the data distribution. Intuitively, models trained to predict these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, {GANs} have no means of learning the inverse mapping – projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks ({BiGANs}) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.},

To avoid annotating the anomalous segments or clips in training videos, which is very time consuming, we propose to learn anomaly through the deep multiple instance ranking framework by leveraging weakly labeled training videos, i.e. the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at videolevel instead of clip-level. In our approach, we consider normal and anomalous videos as bags and video segments as instances in multiple instance learning ({MIL}), and automatically learn a deep anomaly ranking model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous video segments. Furthermore, we introduce sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints in the ranking loss function to better localize anomaly during training.},

Researchers continue to design robust schemes to provide solutions to detect outliers efﬁciently. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and organized review of the progress of outlier detection methods from 2000 to 2019. First, we offer the fundamental concepts of outlier detection and then categorize them into different techniques from diverse outlier detection techniques, such as distance-, clustering-, density-, ensemble-, and learning-based methods. In each category, we introduce some state-ofthe-art outlier detection methods and further discuss them in detail in terms of their performance. Second, we delineate their pros, cons, and challenges to provide researchers with a concise overview of each technique and recommend solutions and possible research directions. This paper gives current progress of outlier detection techniques and provides a better understanding of the different outlier detection methods. The open research issues and challenges at the end will provide researchers with a clear path for the future of outlier detection methods.},

	title = {Efﬁcient Algorithms for Mining Outliers from Large Data Sets},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for distance-based outliers that is based on the distance of a point from its ¥£ ¤§¦ nearest neighbor. We rank each point on the basis of its distance to its £ ¤§¦ nearest neighbor and declare the top ¨ points in this ranking to be outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to ﬁnding such outliers based on the classical nestedloop join and index join algorithms, we develop a highly efﬁcient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm ﬁrst partitions the input data set into disjoint subsets, and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it is determined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings in computation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life and synthetic data sets. The results from a real-life {NBA} database highlight and reveal several expected and unexpected aspects of the database. The results from a study on synthetic data sets demonstrate that the partition-based algorithm scales well with respect to both data set size and data set dimensionality.},

	title = {{CURE}: An Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Large Databases},
	abstract = {Clustering, in data mining, is useful for discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions in the underlying data. Traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very fragile in the presence of outliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called {CURE} that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. {CURE} achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are generated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative point per cluster allows {CURE} to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. To handle large databases, {CURE} employs a combination of random sampling and partitioning. A random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is partially clustered. The partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. Our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by {CURE} is much better than those found by existing algorithms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling and partitioning enable {CURE} to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing clustering quality.},

	title = {{CHAMELEON}: A Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Using Dynamic Modeling},
	abstract = {Clustering in data mining is a discovery process that groups a set of data such that the intracluster similarity is maximized and the intercluster similarity is minimized. Existing clustering algorithms, such as K -means, {PAM}, {CLARANS}, {DBSCAN}, {CURE}, and {ROCK} are designed to ﬁnd clusters that ﬁt some static models. These algorithms can breakdown if the choice of parameters in the static model is incorrect with respect to the data set being clustered, or if the model is not adequate to capture the characteristics of clusters. Furthermore, most of these algorithms breakdown when the data consists of clusters that are of diverse shapes, densities, and sizes. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm called {CHAMELEON} that measures the similarity of two clusters based on a dynamic model. In the clustering process, two clusters are merged only if the inter-connectivity and closeness (proximity) between two clusters are high relative to the internal inter-connectivity of the clusters and closeness of items within the clusters. The merging process using the dynamic model presented in this paper facilitates discovery of natural and homogeneous clusters. The methodology of dynamic modeling of clusters used in {CHAMELEON} is applicable to all types of data as long as a similarity matrix can be constructed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {CHAMELEON} in a number of data sets that contain points in 2D space, and contain clusters of different shapes, densities, sizes, noise, and artifacts. Experimental results on these data sets show that {CHAMELEON} can discover natural clusters that many existing state-of-the art clustering algorithms fail to ﬁnd.},
